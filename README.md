# **Staking DApp**  
A decentralized application (DApp) for staking tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. This application allows users to stake ERC-20 tokens and interact with smart contracts seamlessly through a modern, responsive interface.

---

## **Features**  
- **Token Staking:** Stake and manage ERC-20 tokens with ease.  
- **Smart Contracts:** Powered by robust, secure Solidity smart contracts deployed on Ethereum.  
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Integrated with `react-toastify` for user-friendly feedback and alerts.  
- **Responsive Design:** Built with TailwindCSS for a sleek, modern UI.  
- **Fast Development:** Developed using Vite for blazing-fast builds and live reloading.

## **Deployed Contracts**  

- **Stake Token Contract Address:** `0xE7383b20B73905195E1c71992F1586e8a432dab5`  
- **Staking Contract Address:** `0xb1a7Ab0890CcC0d4B4A4298DeE8766F45b0Bf0d7`  

These smart contracts are deployed on the Ethereum **Sepolia testnet**, ensuring realistic testing with minimal gas fees.

## **Using Remix for Smart Contracts**  
1. Visit [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for compiling and deploying Solidity smart contracts.  
2. Compile the smart contract code using the **Solidity Compiler** in Remix.  
3. Connect Remix to the Sepolia testnet using MetaMask for deployment.  
4. Deploy the contract, and ensure the gas fees are covered using Sepolia testnet ETH.
